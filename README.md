# latticemodels
Simple Monte Carlo simulations of classical spin models like Ising and XY. 
Also, I have included [large deviations theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_deviations_theory) calculations for magnetism in the Ising model. The XY Monte Carlo code was used to generate
some data in my [thesis](https://www.proquest.com/docview/3060673874?fromopenview=true&pq-origsite=gscholar&sourcetype=Dissertations%20&%20Theses).
